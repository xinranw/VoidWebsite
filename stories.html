        <h1>Richmond - Spring 2001</h1>
        <p>
          So I'm captain of the B team with Poncho and we somehow convince Richmond to let us into their tournament. Anyways, this takes place over final 4 weekend, and poncho and I being big NCAA basketball fans want to get their early sat? night so we only miss half of a game on TV. For this tournament, we only had two 21 year olds, both without insurance, and driving 11 people down in 2 styling Grand Marquis station wagons. Before we leave, Lucky being anal is worried about the weather reports saying that it might rain. Poncho and I say screw that, we're going.<br>We get to Richmond, stop at a supermarket and buy 40s for 99 cents and some mixing milk(more expensive than the 40s). Eat our dinner, check into the hotel, and Lucky convinces me to call my house to have someone check my email to see if the tourney's still on. It is of course cancelled, or else this wouldn't be a good story. So people resort to the 40's and caucasians and our little green friend and we decide to party it up at the richmond campus. I give directions to both cars, with Lubow giving directions to Pacey in 1, and me giving directions to Poncho in the other. Pacey's car promptly gets lost, so lets forget about them for a while. Assume they all went back to sleep in 1 room since we had the keys to the other. We get to campus, park, and its Poncho, me, Kazan, Larry, and the star of this story ODB.
        </p>
        <p>
          We go to some frat party, that ODB tries to get us into by saying he knows a brother at some other school. I actually do know someone at Richmond in a frat, but I have no idea whether its this one or not. Its not. We go across frat row and have to stop for ODB to piss in the direction of a cop walking our way. He wasn't busted, but maybe he should have been. We go to some other house that isn't a frat and just walk in and grab some cups for the keg. While walking around, we see a guy with a disc who turns out to be a Richmond player. There's actually a lot of players in the party so we go outside and toss in the parking lot, larry asks about strip clubs and we arrange to scrimmage them the next morning(at some other schools campus to ruin their fields) so its not a waste of a drive down. They invite us back to their dorms were a lot of them live together and have Beirut set up. i go off to hang out in some other room and play foosball, and when i come back, ODB is really drunk, has been talking to this youngish girl who he thinks is someone else and saying Jigga, Jigga- wa or something nonsensical over and over. He stumbles into a dresser and overall is pretty messed up. We believe he played 1 game of Beirut.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we go, he's gotta piss so we wait for him while Poncho kindof follows him in to make sure he's OK. There's dribble down his pant leg when he starts to cry out. &quot;My Cock. Poncho, I can't find my cock.&quot; The person in the bathroom with him immediately leaves. As we wander back to the car, he comes under the impression that i pissed on his leg and yells at me &quot;Neville, i'm gunna get you Neville&quot; (the origin of my nickname of sorts). 
          <br>
          We get him into the car, and rather than sit 3 in the back, larry chooses to be in the middle of the front so he doesn't have to be next to ODB. ODB is going in and out of sleep, falling onto my lap, until i push him back up. At one point he's not looking so great so Poncho rolls down his window, and I tell ODB if he has to throw up, do it out the window. In slow motion, he turns to the window, looks out for 5 seconds and throws up all over the window sill, mainly into the car. We have to stop at a gas station to buy cleaning supplies, and we obviously want ODB to clean it up, but he's in no condition, so we have to. We do a decent job, and before getting back into the car ODB starts to move to put his hand into his pocket. There's puke on that hand. Like with the window, as slow as possible despite our protestations, he puts in his pocket. After getting lost for a while, we make it back to the hotel, toss ODB in the room with all of the other people, and go to Waffle house. We make it back at 4am, and get up the next morning at like 9. ODB has no recollection so we happily tell him that he hooked up with a 15 year old(the young girl he thought he knew), went into the car with her, and threw up on her. He believed it until someone told him on the ride home after Richmond killed us in the scrimmage.

        <h1>Haverford Layout Pigout Spring 2000 (sort of)</h1>
        <p> 
          After coming back from Haverford the Saturday of Fling, it was about 5 o'clock, so after taking a shower, I immediately started drinking to make up for lost time. Every one else around me was gone at this point  since they started when they got up. By 7 o'clock I had caught up to everyone,  and by 8, I think I surpassed them. We were all getting hungry so we went  to this festival in the middle of the high rises that supposedly had food.  It turned out that all they had were pretzels. In my disgust (and drunken  state) I took about 20 leis that they were handing out, and ran away trying  to put them on people. That was the last thing I remember until 10 o'clock  at night. In the meantime, we evidentially went to a Cav's, I ordered a  chicken parm sandwich, got up to go to the bathroom, and never came back.  My friends were freaking out thinking that I had passed out somewhere so  they searched the whole restaurant including the ladies room, and the surrounding  block. I was nowhere to be found. They ended up paying for my meal, and putting it in a doggie bag. They went back to our hall and started asking people if they had seen me. They had not. I guess they eventually gave me up for lost.<br> <br> In the meanwhile, at around 10, I "awoke" from my memory blackout, and found myself in a part of Philly that I had never seen before. I started  freaking out, so my "logical mind" somehow told me to get on a highway  since that would be the fastest or easiest way back. In my mind, I thought  I was following someone as I ran along the shoulder of a major superhighway  for a good 15 minutes, including over a bridge. I either eventually realized  what I was doing was stupid or thought that I was going to stay on the  highway for too long, so I crossed it, and attempted to run up a steep  embankment. I obviously fell back down. I repeated this about 3 more times  before finally making it to the top into a wooded area of some sort. All  the while, including on the highway, I was sprinting since I really, really  wanted to get back as fast as I could so I obviously fell down a lot which  resulting in torn pants, cut up hands and arms, and me being generally soaked since it rained all day. I ran in the woods for a while alongside a fence with barbwire on top, and on the other side were train tracks after a 15-foot drop-off. The tracks eventually came to the same level as the forest, so I took off my shirt, threw it over the barbed wire, climbed the fence, and fell onto the other side. After crossing the tracks, I somehow made my way to a corporate park. (at the time i thought thats what it was. &nbsp;it was probably just part of fairmount).
        </p> 
        <p> 
          After running around there for a while, I made it to city streets.  This should have been fine then, but I was only a freshman, and still  very naiive and drunk. I asked a guy sort of passed on a bench how to  get back to 37th and Spruce. &nbsp;He gave me directions, so i started  running. &nbsp;He then started shouting that i was going the wrong way,  but he was a scary homeless man so i kept on running. &nbsp;I eventually  found my way to the art museum. I had run from campus to there a couple  times so I thought I was in the clear. I was wrong. It was not the Art museum. &nbsp;I guess it&nbsp; was one of those mansions in Fairmout Park. It took another 45 minutes of sprinting this way and that before I finally made my way back to campus. It was around 12:30 or 1 at this point. I promptly took off my ruined clothes, washed the blood off my hands, set my alarm and went to bed. The next morning at 7:45 I woke up for ultimate with incredibly sore muscles, and my hands wouldn't work since they were so bruised and battered. When I got back to campus that afternoon, everyone was asking, what happened to you? Where did you go? And they had as good an idea as I did. 
          <br> <br> 
          Notes: &nbsp;I wrote the above narrative not long after it happened,  and only just now edited it a bit as i know the city better. &nbsp;This  past summer, I was running(for training, not drunkenly) around Girard  Ave, and i now think i know where i went. &nbsp;Below is a possible map.
